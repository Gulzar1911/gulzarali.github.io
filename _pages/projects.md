Simulation of Fluid Flow through Porous Media
======
This project is oriented to the modelling of imbibition process in porous media and validations with experiments. First phase of this project was to validate Washburn's Equation with Simulation Results. Then we modify paper parameters in order to get max time and slowest flow rate. In our analysis we have done simulations with water and castor oil. Application of this project is vast, often found in natural formations like soil or engineered materials like filter papers. Making it very important field of study specially in geosciences. In our project, it is more inclined toward engineered porous media, where we find suitable parameters for paper to be used in these small fluidic sensors known as flexible time-temperature Indicators FTTIs.

Deep Learning Enhanced CFD Modelling of Data Centers
======
In this project, deep learning techniques are integrated with traditional CFD to optimize thermal management in data centers. Data centers generate significant heat, and efficient cooling is essential to maintain performance and reduce energy costs. This model combines AI with CFD simulations to predict hotspot formation and optimize cooling strategies, enhancing energy efficiency.

Finite Element Code for 2D Problem
======
This project involves creating a finite element analysis (FEA) code to solve 2D structural problems, such as stress and deformation in materials under load. Using FEA, we break down a complex structure into smaller elements to calculate how forces distribute across the material. This project provides a foundation for analyzing mechanical stability and performance.

Second Order Vortex Panel Method
======
The Vortex Panel Method is a numerical technique used in aerodynamics to model the flow of air around objects like airfoils. By discretizing the objectâ€™s surface into small panels with vortex strengths, this method helps to visualize and compute the flow patterns and pressure distribution around an airfoil.

Multiphase Flow Simulation through Microchannels
======
This project explores the behavior of multiphase flows (e.g., gas-liquid) within microchannels, which are commonly used in applications like microfluidic devices and cooling systems. Modeling multiphase flow regimes in these narrow channels helps improve the design of cooling systems and other small-scale fluidic devices by optimizing flow behavior for specific applications.
