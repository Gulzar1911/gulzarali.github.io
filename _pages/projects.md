Simulation of Fluid Flow through porous Media
======
![Fluid Flow through Porous Media](/images/projects/saturation_3D.gif)
This project focuses on the dynamics of fluid flow within porous materials, often found in natural formations like soil or engineered materials like filters. By using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), we simulate how fluid moves through porous media (filter paper). Goal of this project was to model wicking process and delay the process of wicking as much as we can by changing controlling parameters. That will ultimatly used to find best suitable filter paper to be used in Flexible Time Temperature Indicators (FTTIs). FTTIs are small sensors used in cold storage to check which item is more exposed to high temperature. By increasing the fluid flow rate one can modify these sensors to be used for wide range of products.

Deep learning enhanced CFD modelling of Datacenters
======

In this project, deep learning techniques are integrated with traditional CFD to optimize thermal management in data centers. Data centers generate significant heat, and efficient cooling is essential to maintain performance and reduce energy costs. By developing a model that learns from CFD simulations, we can predict temperature distribution and hotspot locations, enabling proactive cooling strategies. This fusion of AI and CFD helps in reducing computational load and improving the sustainability of data center operations.

Finite Element Code for 2D Problem
======
This project involves creating a finite element analysis (FEA) code to solve 2D structural problem, such as stress and deformation in materials under load. Using FEA, we break down a complex structure into smaller elements and solve for each, providing insights into the overall behavior of the material. This code can be applied to structural engineering problems, helping predict material performance under various conditions and guiding the design of safer, more efficient structures. Further, I validated this code with ANSYS Simulation.

Second order Vortex Panel Method
======
![Streamlines computed with Vortex Panel Method](images/projects/Streamlines.jpg)
The Vortex Panel Method is a numerical technique used in aerodynamics to model the flow of air around objects like airfoils. By discretizing the objectâ€™s surface into small panels with vortex strengths, this method calculates lift and other aerodynamic properties efficiently. This project involves implementing the vortex panel method to analyze flow fields around an airfoil and calculates lift and drag coefficients, providing a fundamental tool for aerodynamic design in industries such as aviation and automotive engineering.

Multiphase flow Simulation through microchannels
======
![Flow Regime in Microchannel](/images/projects/Volume_Fraction_later_part.gif)
This project explores the behavior of multiphase flows (e.g., gas-liquid) within microchannels, which are commonly used in applications like microfluidic devices and cooling systems. Modeling multiphase flow requires complex simulations to capture interactions between phases, flow regimes, and channel geometries. In this project, we simulated air and water in y shaped microchannel having three inlets one air and two water and one outlet. Our goal was to capture all the flow regimes and vortex induced in the flow. By simulating these flows, we can optimize microchannel designs for efficient mixing, heat transfer, and other targeted outcomes, benefiting fields like biomedical engineering and chemical processing.
